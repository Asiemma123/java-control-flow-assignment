		// 2. Make a loop that repeatedly asks the user for a number and won't stop
		// until the user answers using a negative number
		// 3. Add some error checking for when a user inputs a number over 100 - we
		// should skip that input and start the loop
		// over to ask again

		
		
		
		
		// 4. Calculate the average of all scores collected during the loop

		// - If over 90: "Excellent Work!"
		// - If over 80: "Good Job!"
		// - If over 70: "Keep it up!"
		// - anything else: "Let's work hard to get those grades up!"
